Until the day I met you.
Just hearing your voice, seeing your smile,
Shines a light within me, even on my darkest days.
I never imagined that writing a poem could bring such bliss,
Yet, here I am, overwhelmed by the joy it brings.
I can't fathom the patience I've discovered within myself,
Waiting for your message,
Each moment an adventure,
Blissfully improving my heart with every word.
I never imagined watching esports with someone could be so much fun,
The flicks and the crazy rounds each tell their own story,
And I get so excited just to share them with you.
I never imagined I would crave to share my whole day with another,
Until the day Ceci entered my story.
I never knew I had so much kindness and care within me,
Until I found her, and she brought out the child in me.
 
If fateâ€™s design holds true and no one else intrudes,
I yearn to spend a lifetime by her side,
Embracing each day with boundless joy,
Turning every dream and imagination into reality
In every breath and heartbeat,
I wish to treasure our moments,
Forever grateful for the serendipity
That allowed me to be part of her life
